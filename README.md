## The Chat Bot 
There are so many forums out there where people answer each other’s questions. Do we really still need people to do that? Aren’t most questions answered already? For some topics it sure feels like all questions must have been answered by now. By eliminating the need for human interaction, your answer should be available way quicker. 

This chat bot will let you state your question and get an automatic answer!
